                <p>Some mornings, I oversleep.<br>The alarm screams, I hit snooze,<br>and before I know it, an hour’s gone.<br>My coffee’s cold before I take a sip,<br>and the day already feels like it’s slipping away.</p>

                <p>It’s getting out of bed<br>when you’d rather stay buried under the covers.<br>It’s speaking up when your voice wavers.<br>It’s making a choice—even a tiny one—<br>when doubt tells you to stand still.</p>

                <p>No one has it all figured out.<br>We try, we fail, we start over.<br>And maybe that’s the whole point.<br>Maybe life isn’t about getting it perfect,<br>but about showing up, however messy or uncertain it feels.</p>
